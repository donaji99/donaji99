## Integration of the Keras API

Actually, Keras is one of the greatest APIs on the planet for DeepLearning. Now Keras has been eaten up by TensorFlow. A bit sad, but in reality it doesn't make any difference since nearly everyone used Keras on top of TensorFlow anyway. So let's consider Keras to be part of TensorFlow (or TensorFlow to be part of Keras). The cool thing is, that you now can use the straightforward, and easy to use Keras API and still can claim to be a TensorFlow developer. Yeah, Google made Keras the official high level API of TensorFlow.

So you might think, so what? Just some imports change. But this is only one part of the story. Yes, the imports changed, and as you can see later in the example, you can basically leave your existing Keras code intact most of the times and just change the import and you are done.

But in addition, Keras now can make use of built-in TensorFlow functionality which wasn't possible before. For example, you can take your 1:1 Keras code and TensorFlow will scale it to a large GPU or TPU cluster. We'll have a look at this in the next chapter.

For now, just follow along the video and code exercise below to get an idea how things work:
